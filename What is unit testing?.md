## What is unit testing?
Simply put -- unit testing is a method for testing software.

Unit testing breaks up code into the smallest possible testable pieces, called 'units'. Units are often classes, functions, or even just lines of code. Importantly, units must be isolated -- that is, they must not rely on external systems like databases, file systems, networks, or system configurations.[^1]

By using unit testing, if/when errors are found, we know their location to high precision
