## What is unit testing?
Simply put -- unit testing is a method for testing software.

Unit testing breaks up code into the smallest possible testable pieces (usually classes, functions, or individual lines), called 'units'. Importantly, units must be isolated -- that is, they must not rely on external systems like databases, file systems, networks, or system configurations.[^1]

The idea of using unit testing is that if bugs are found, their location is known to high precision. Instead of knowing there's an bug *somewhere* in, say, 500 lines of code, this bug would be known to be in a small class, function, or even a specific line. This makes it much easier to catch and fix bugs.

## Example 1

```python
print("Helo world!")
```

## Example 2
